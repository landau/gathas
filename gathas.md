Great garuda bird, hungry spirits in immense wastelands, mother and child starving in the desert, the balm of compassion satisfies all their hunger.

##### Before Eating 
The Buddha advises us to be mindful while we eat, to be in touch with the Sangha and the food. Brothers and sisters, when you hear the bell, meditate on the Five Contemplations: This food is the gift of the whole universe the earth, the sky, and much hard work. May we be worthy to receive it. May we transform unskillful states of mind, especially the habit of eating without moderation. May we take only foods that nourish us and prevent illness. We accept this food to realize the path of understanding and love.

The meal is finished, and I am satisfied. The four gratitudes are deeply in my mind.

##### Impermanence 
The day is ending and our life is one day shorter. Let us look carefully at what we have done. Let us practice diligently, putting our whole heart into the path of meditation. Let us live deeply each moment and in freedom, so the time doesn’t slip away meaninglessly.

##### Praising the Buddha 
The Buddha jewel shines infinitely. He has realized perfect enlightenment for countless lifetimes. The beauty and stability of a Buddha sitting can be seen in the mountains and rivers. How splendid is the Vulture Peak! How beautiful the light that shines forth from Buddha’s third eye illuminating the six dark paths. The Nagapuspa assembly will be our next appointment for the continuation of the true teachings and practices. We take refuge in the Buddha ever-present.

##### Praising the Dharma 
The Dharma jewel is infinitely lovely. It is the precious words spoken by the Buddha himself, like fragrant flowers floating down from the heavens. The wonderful Dharma is plain to see.

We vow to study it with all our heart, and take refuge in the Dharma ever-present.

##### Praising the Sangha 
The Sangha jewel is infinitely precious, a field of merit where good seeds can be sown. The three robes and the bowl are symbols of freedom. Precepts, concentration, and insight support each other.

With one heart, we come home to the Sangha, and take refuge in the Sangha ever-present.

##### Breathing (Version 1) 
Going back to the island of self, I see Buddha is my mindfulness shining near, shining far. Dharma is my breathing guarding body and mind. Sangha is my five skandhas working in harmony. Breathing in, breathing out. Flower, fresh. Mountain, solid. Water, reflecting. Space, free.

##### Breathing (Version 2) 
Breathing in, I know I am breathing in. Breathing out, I know I am breathing out. As my in-breath grows deep, my out-breath grows slow. Breathing in, I calm my body Breathing out, I feel ease.

Two-thirds of accidents take place near home. Knowing this, I am very careful even on a short trip.

##### Looking at the Buddha Image before Touching the Earth 
In the realm of suchness, the one who bows and the one who is bowed to are equally empty of a separate self. With deep respect, I bow to Buddha in this spirit, and the communication is perfect. Buddhas manifest in all directions. In the Interbeing Cosmos, as in every jewel of Indra’s net, There are countless me’s bowing to countless Buddhas.
